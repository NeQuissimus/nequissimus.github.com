<h3>Welcome to my website!</h3>
<br /><br />
My name is Tim Steinbach and I am a software developer. Take a look around to find out about me and some of my work.<br />You can find information about my very own Kiwi.app (A twitter client for Mac) theme called <a href="#" onclick="javascript:grab('carbonkiwi');">CarbonKiwi</a> as well as <a href="#" onclick="javascript:grab('pogoping');">pogoPing</a>. <a href="#" onclick="javascript:grab('trillian2adium');">Trillian2Adium</a> is also something I have created during my transition to the Mac. Maybe you can use some of these tools.
