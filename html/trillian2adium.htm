<h1>Trillian2Adium</h1></p>
<p><h2>Description</h2>
A lot of people have recently bought Macs after having had PCs for years. Trillian is one of the most popular messengers for Windows. Wouldn't you like to have all your older logs on your new computer? With Trillian2Adium you can convert all your Trillian logs into Adium transcripts!</p>
<p><h2>How-To</h2>
Place all the .xml files Trillian has created into a separate folder. Copy this .app into the same folder and run the .app. There should be one folder for each .xml file. This folder will contain the proper Adium transcripts which will have to be copied to &#126;/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Users/default/Logs/XXX XXX has to be replaced by the account you have used to create the logs files in Trillian (e.g. ICQ.12345678) After that all transcripts can be found in Adium's Transcript Viewer.<br />
Finally, delete the folder &#126;/Library/Caches/Adium for Adium to create a new search index for all the newly added transcripts.</p>
