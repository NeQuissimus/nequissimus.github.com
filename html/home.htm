<p>Welcome to my website!<br /><br />My name is Tim Steinbach and I am a software developer. Take a look around to find out about me and some of my work.<br />You can find information about my very own Kiwi.app (A twitter client for Mac) theme as well as pogoPing. Trillian2Adium is also something I have created during my transition to the Mac. Maybe you can use some of these tools.<br />Also, check out the "About" section, as some of the graphics on this website have not been designed by me.</p>
